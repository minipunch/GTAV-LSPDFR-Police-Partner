# GTAV-LSPDFR-Police-Partner
A lightweight **police partner plugin** I made for the LSPD: First Response GTA V modification.


The streets of Los Santos are *very* dangerous! I shouldn't have to tell you that if you are an experienced officer like myself. Well fear *no more* because you can now take a partner on patrol with you!
This plugin gives the ability for the user to have a partner while on patrol.

**KEYBINDINGS:**

**F9 - Spawn a partner**

*NOTE: Current version only supports spawning of a Los Santos Sheriff model. Ability to choose from more models is in the woodworks.*
